## Notes {.build}

A piece of open research doesn't automatically make it good, where
good is defined as of high academic quality.


A piece of reproducible research doesn't automatically make it good,
where good is defined as of high academic quality.

## Open and reproducible research

> `Open != reproducible`

Open research and reproducible research aren't the same thing, and one
doesn't imply the other. They are historically also very different.

## 

- World Data Center system (now the World Data System) in 1966.

- MEDLINE (now PubMed) in 1966.
  
- Open science has seen a continuous evolution since the 17th century,
  with the advent of dissemination of research in scientific journals
  and the societal demand to access scientific knowledge at
  large. Technology and communication has further accelerated this
  evolution, and put it in the spot light among researchers and
  academics (for for examples funder mandates) and more widely in the
  press with the cost of publications (see for example this Guardian
  *long read* article [Is the staggeringly profitable business of
  scientific publishing bad for
  science?](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science)
  or the [Paywall](https://paywallthemovie.com/) movie).

## [The Mertonian norms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mertonian_norms) (1942)

- **Communism**: all scientists should have common ownership of
  scientific goods (intellectual property), to promote collective
  collaboration; secrecy is the opposite of this norm.

- **Universalism**: scientific validity is independent of the
  sociopolitical status/personal attributes of its participants.

- **Disinterestedness**: scientific institutions act for the benefit of a
  common scientific enterprise, rather than for the personal gain of
  individuals within them
  
- **Organised scepticism**: scientific claims should be exposed to
  critical scrutiny before being accepted: both in methodology and
  institutional codes of conduct.

##

Open science/research is the process of transparent dissemination and
access to knowledge, that can be applied to various scientific
practices (The six principles of open science image from Wikipedia):

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Open_Science_-_Prinzipien.png)

## As a result {.build}

> Open science/research can mean different things to different people,
> in particular when declined along its many technical and
> philosophical attributes.

Take home message:

`Open isn't binary, it's a gradient.`

How to be an open scientist: 

`Let's be open and understanding of different situations and constraints.`

## Why becoming an open research practitioners (1)

- It's the right thing to do. See the **The Mertonian norms**... Or is it?

- **Benefits for your academic career**: some examples from the
  [**Open as a career
  boost**](https://lgatto.github.io/EPFL-open-science/) paragraph.

- **Networking opportunities**

- **Get more funding**: Meet funder requirements, and qualify for
  special funds such as the Wellcome Trust [Open Research
  Fund](https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/schemes/open-research-fund).

## Why becoming an open research practitioners (2)

- **Get that promotion**: Open research is increasingly recognised in
  promotion and tenure. See also [Reproducibility and open science are
  starting to matter in tenure and
  promotion](https://cos.io/blog/are-reproducibility-and-open-science-starting-matter-tenure-and-promotion-review/)
  July 14th, 2017, Brian Nosek) and the EU's [Evaluation of Research
  Careers fully acknowledging Open Science
  Practice](https://cdn1.euraxess.org/sites/default/files/policy_library/os-rewards-wgreport-final_integrated_0.pdf)
  defines an Open Science Career Assessment Matrix (OS-CAM):

## But are there **any risks**?

`Does it take more time to work openly?`

Isn't it worth investing time is managing data in a way that others
(including future self) can find and understand it? That's, IMHO,
particularly important from a group leader's perspective, where I want
to build a corpus of data/software/research that other lab members can
find, mine and re-use.

`Are senior academics always supportive?`

No.

`Is there a risk of being scooped?`

There certainly is a benefit if releasing one's research early!

## 

But, importantly, working with open and reproducible research in mind
doesn't mean releasing everything prematurely, it means

- managing research in a way one can find data and results at every
  stage

- one can reproduce results, re-run/compare them with new data or
  different methods/parameters, and

- one can release data (or parts thereof) when/if appropriate.


## So, are there any risks?

> research and publication environment.

## Why reproducibility is important

- For **scientific reasons**: think reproducibility crisis.

- For **political reasons**: public trust in science, in data, in
  experts; without (public) trust in science and research, there won't
  be any funding anymore.


## But what do we mean by reproducibility?

From a [*But what to we mean by
reproducibility?*](https://lgatto.github.io/rr-what-should-be-our-goals/)
blog post.

- **Repeat** my experiment i.e. obtain the same tables/graphs/results
  using the same setup (data, software, ...) in the same lab or on the
  same computer.
- **Reproduce** an experiment (not mine) i.e. obtain the same
  tables/graphs/results in a different lab or on a different computer,
  using the same setup.
- **Replicate** an experiment, i.e. obtain the same (similar enough)
  tables/graphs/results in a different set up.
- Finally, **re-use** the information/knowledge from one experiment to
  run a different experiment with the aim to confirm results from
  scratch.

Another view (from a talk by [Kirstie
Whitaker](https://figshare.com/articles/Publishing_a_reproducible_paper/4720996/1)):

|                    | Same Data | Different Data |
|--------------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Same Code**      | reproduce | replicate      |
| **Different Code** | robust    | generalisable  |

`(Computational) Reproducibility Is Not The Point`

## The goal is trust, verification and guarantees:

- **Trust in Reporting** - result is accurately reported
- **Trust in Implementation** - analysis code successfully implements
  chosen methods
- **Statistical Trust** - data and methods are (still) appropriate
- **Scientific Trust** - result convincingly supports claim(s) about
  underlying systems or truths

`Reproducibility isn't binary, it's a gradient.`



`Reproducibility isn't easy.`



(But then why becoming a reproducible research practitioners?)

## Why becoming a reproducible research practitioners

Florian Markowetz, [**Five selfish reasons to work
reproducibly**](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-015-0850-7), Genome
Biology 2015, 16:274.

> And so, my fellow scientists: ask not what you can do for
> reproducibility; ask what reproducibility can do for you! Here, I
> present five reasons why working reproducibly pays off in the long
> run and is in the self-interest of every ambitious, career-oriented
> scientist.

## Five selfish reasons to work reproducibly {.build}

1. **reproducibility helps to avoid disaster**
2. **reproducibility makes it easier to write papers**
3. **reproducibility helps reviewers see it your way**
4. **reproducibility enables continuity of your work**
5. **reproducibility helps to build your reputation**

And career perspectives: [Faculty promotion must assess
reproducibility](https://www.nature.com/news/faculty-promotion-must-assess-reproducibility-1.22596).

## What can you do to improve trust in (your) research? {.build}

1. **Be an open research practitioners**
2. **Be an reproducible research practitioners**

Includes (but not limited to)

## {.build}

`Preprints are the best!`

Read, post, review and cite **preprints** (see
[ASAPbio](https://asapbio.org/) for lots of resources about
preprints).

`Promoting open research through peer review`

* Accept sound/valid research and provide constructive comments

and hence

* Focus firstly on the validity of the research by inspecting the
  data, software and method. If the methods and/or data fail, the rest
  is meaningless.

## 

1. **Availability**: Are the data/software/methods accessible and
   understandable in a way that would allow an informed researcher to
   reproduce and/or verify the results underlying the claims?

2. **Meta-data**: It's of course not enough to provide a wild dump of
   the data/software/..., but these need to be appropriately
   documented. 

3. **Do numbers match?**: The first thing when reproducing someone's
   analysis is to match the data files to the experimental
   design. 
  
4. **What data, what format**: Is the data readable with standard and
   open/free software? Are the raw and processed available, and have
   the authors described how to get from one to the other? 

5. **License**: Is the data shared in a way that allows users to
   re-use it. Under what conditions? 

##

Make sure that the data adhere to the
**[FAIR](http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) principles**:

`Findable and Accessible and Interoperable and Reusable`

## 
As a quick note, my *ideal* review system would be one where

1. Submit your data to a repository, where it gets checked (by
   specialists, data scientists, data curators) for quality,
   annotation, meta-data.

2. Submit your research with a link to the peer reviewed data. First
   review the intro and methods, then only the results (to avoid
   positive results bias).

##

When talking about open research and peer review, one logical
extension is **open peer review**. 

While I personally value open peer review and practice it when
possible, it can be a difficult issue for ECRs, exposing them
unnecessarily when reviewing work from prominent peers. It also can
reinforce an already unwelcoming environment for underrepresented
minorities. See more about this in the *Inclusivity: open science and
open science* section below.

## Registered reports

Define you data collection and analysis protocol in advance. Get it
reviewed and, if accepted, get right to publish once data have been
collected and analysed, irrespective of the (positive or negative)
result.



See
[https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000246](Open
science challenges, benefits and tips in early career and beyond)
(2019).

**Three challenges**

- Restrictions on flexibility
- The time cost
- Incentive structure isn’t in place yet

**Three benefits**

- Greater faith in research
- New helpful systems (see technical solutions below)
- Investment in your future

## Make allies 

> This is **very** important!

- Other ECR
- Librarians
- Data stewards/champions
- Research Software engineers
- On/off-line networking

## 

Open research can lead to collaborative research (here's [one
example](https://lgatto.github.io/msnbase-contribs/) I am very proud
of).

## Just do it!


`Build openness at the core your research`

(according to you possibilities)

Open and reproducible research doesn't work if it's an afterthought. 

## Technical solutions

- Scripting, scripting, scripting.

- Avoid manual steps.

- Document everything, especially manual steps (which you should avoid anyway).

- Version control, such as git/[github](https://lgatto.github.io/github-intro/), bitbucket, ...

- Literate analyses: reproducible documents with R markdown, Sweave (R
  with LaTeX), Juyter notebooks, ...

- Shareable compute environments (docker containers).

- Document and **share** all artefacts related to your research (when
  possible): data, code, [protocols](https://www.protocols.io/), ...

## Inclusivity

[Open research and open research](https://lgatto.github.io/open-and-open/)

There is 

`Open Science as in widely disseminated and openly accessible`

and

`Open Science as in inclusive and welcoming`

##

Even if there are efforts to promote diversity, under-represented
minorities (URM) don't necessarily feel
[included](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/357/6356/1101.full).
When it comes to open science/research URMs can be further
discriminated against by greater exposure or, can't always afford to
be vocal.

- Not everybody has the privilege to be open.
- There are different levels in how open one wants, or how open one
  could afford to be.
- Every voice and support is welcome.


## Conclusions (1)

> **Standing on the shoulders of giants** only really makes sense in
> the context of open and reproducible research.

- If you are here (or have read this), chances are you are on the path
  towards open and reproducible research.

- You are the architect of the kind of research and researcher you
  want to become. I hope these include openness and reproducibility.


## Conclusions (2)

> **Standing on the shoulders of giants** only really makes sense in
> the context of open and reproducible research.

- It's a long path, that constantly evolves, depending on constraints,
  aspirations, environment, ...
  
- The sky is the limit, be creative: work out the (open and
  reproducible) research that works for you now ...
  
- ... and that you want to work (for you and others) in the future.
